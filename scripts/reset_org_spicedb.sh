# Outputs all bootstrap relationships for a given org ID to a file
# This file can be piped the zed relationship delete in order to delete them
# This is NOT compatible with orgs that have more relationships 
# than those that come with bootstrapping and default / admin group memberships.
# That is, once dual write is on or migration has run, this cannot be safely used.
# It may miss relationships or not parse the output relationships correctly.
# Using it of course assumes the org is cleared or re-bootstrapped in RBAC as well.
# To do this, the workspaces and tenant mappings must be removed.
# If there are any bindingmappings, this script cannot be used (it means migration has run or dual write is on)

# This script takes an org_id and assumes a local zed context against the correct environment.
