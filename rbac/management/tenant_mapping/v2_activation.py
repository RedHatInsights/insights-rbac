"""V2 write activation state for tenants.

Provides functions to lock and check whether a tenant has been activated for V2
writes. Once activated, a tenant must never write via V1 again, regardless of
feature flag state.

Uses SELECT FOR SHARE for read-lock checks so concurrent V1/V2 reads do not
block each other. Django ORM has no FOR SHARE equivalent so raw SQL is used
for that path only. The write path (escalating to exclusive) uses the ORM's
select_for_update().

The SQL strings are static literals with no interpolation; the only runtime value
(tenant_id) is always passed as a parameterized %s placeholder, so there is no
SQL injection risk despite the Sourcery warning.

Usage:
    # In V2 write paths (inside SERIALIZABLE transaction):
    ensure_v2_write_activated(tenant)

    # In V1 write paths (inside transaction):
    assert_v1_write_allowed(tenant)
