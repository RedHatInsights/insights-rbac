"""System user helper utilities for permission checks.

This module provides shared helper functions for identifying and checking
system users (used for service-to-service communication). These helpers
are used by both the WorkspaceAccessPermission class and the is_user_allowed_v2
function to ensure consistent behavior.

The main entry point is `check_system_user_access()` which encapsulates the
complete decision tree for system user access, preventing behavior drift
between different call sites.
