    # 3. Add configuration for `route.by.field` in Debezium
    # 4. Start writing events with the new partition key, with a new value for this field.
    #    Events in the WAL with the global key will be routed to the "old" topic,
    #    while events with the new partition key(s) will be routed to a new topic.
