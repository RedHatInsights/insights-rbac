    """
    FilterBackend that enforces workspace visibility via Kessel Inventory API.

    This filter:
    - Applies ONLY to v2 workspace endpoints
    - Uses is_user_allowed_v2 which internally selects the appropriate API:
      - List (workspace_id=None): StreamedListObjects, sets request.permission_tuples
      - Detail (workspace_id specified): CheckForUpdate (single resource check)
    - Filters queryset to only include workspaces user can access
    - Returns 404 for inaccessible workspaces on detail views (no existence leak)

    Why FilterBackend over Permission class:
    - Permission classes are for coarse-grained endpoint access (can user call this endpoint?)
    - FilterBackends are for data filtering (what data can user see?)
    - This separation follows DRF best practices and single responsibility principle
