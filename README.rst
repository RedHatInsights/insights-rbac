About
~~~~~

Insights RBAC's goal is to provide an open source solution for storing roles, permissions and policies.

Full documentation is available through readthedocs_.


Getting Started
===============

This is a Python project developed using Python 3.6. Make sure you have at least this version installed.

Development
===========

To get started developing against Insights-rbac first clone a local copy of the git repository. ::

    git clone https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-rbac.git

Developing inside a virtual environment is recommended. A Pipfile is provided. Pipenv is recommended for combining virtual environment (virtualenv) and dependency management (pip). To install pipenv, use pip ::

    pip3 install pipenv

Then project dependencies and a virtual environment can be created using ::

    pipenv install --dev

To activate the virtual environment run ::

    pipenv shell

Preferred Environment
---------------------

Please refer to `Working with Openshift`_.

Alternative Environment
-----------------------
If deploying with Openshift seems overly complex you can try an alternate local environment where you will need to install and setup some of the dependencies and configuration.

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This project is developed using the Django web framework. Many configuration settings can be read in from a `.env` file. An example file `.env.example` is provided in the repository. To use the defaults simply ::

    cp .env.example .env


Modify as you see fit.

Database
^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL is used as the database backend for Insights-rbac. A docker-compose file is provided for creating a local database container. If modifications were made to the .env file the docker-compose file will need to be modified to ensure matching database credentials. Several commands are available for interacting with the database. ::

    # This will launch a Postgres container
    make start-db

    # This will run Django's migrations against the database
    make run-migrations

    # This will stop and remove a currently running database and run the above commands
    make reinitdb

Assuming the default .env file values are used, to access the database directly using psql run ::

    psql rbac -U rbacadmin -h localhost -p 15432

There is a known limitation with docker-compose and Linux environments with SELinux enabled. You may see the following error during the postgres container deployment::

    "mkdir: cannot create directory '/var/lib/pgsql/data/userdata': Permission denied" can be resolved by granting ./pg_data ownership permissions to uid:26 (postgres user in centos/postgresql-96-centos7)

If a docker container running Postgres is not feasible, it is possible to run Postgres locally as documented in the Postgres tutorial_. The default port for local Postgres installations is `5432`. Make sure to modify the `.env` file accordingly. To initialize the database run ::

    make run-migrations

Server
^^^^^^

To run a local dev Django server you can use ::

    make serve

To run the local dev Django on a specific port use::

    make PORT=8111 serve

API Documentation Generation
----------------------------

To generate and host the API documentation locally you need to `Install APIDoc`_.

Generate the project API documenttion by running the following command ::

  make gen-apidoc

In order to host the docs locally you need to collect the static files ::

  make collect-static

Now start the server with as described above and point your browser to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/apidoc/index.html**.

Testing and Linting
-------------------

Insights-rbac uses tox to standardize the environment used when running tests. Essentially, tox manages its own virtual environment and a copy of required dependencies to run tests. To ensure a clean tox environment run ::

    tox -r

This will rebuild the tox virtual env and then run all tests.

To run unit tests specifically::

    tox -e py36

To lint the code base ::

    tox -e lint
